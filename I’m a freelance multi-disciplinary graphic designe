Detailed-oriented, responsible and committed engineer with a get-it-done on time and high-quality product spirit and more than 4 years of experience defining requirements, designing, development, testing and delivering complex back-end and web application using various programming languages and technologies.

I love building, new things starting from a blank whiteboard or early stage prototype and transferring it into something people truly value, I have done this repeatedly at companies I worked.

Ever since my childhood I have had a passion for software engineering, As I grew older, I studied a computer science and engineering. 
Time and effort if put together, definitely leads to success. I still remember that day, when I developed social networking project at 
the age of 19 (January-2012). I didnâ€™t realize how the time drifted off so quickly. These comprehensive efforts were aptly rewarded 
when my project was used by hundreds of thousands of people across the globe and was appreciated by Asian News International and many 
other news channels. This experience in developing a social networking website aspired me, and 
just after a year I developed web based content-management framework, which helped people to develop websites  without 
any programming skills and again I was appreciated by Asian News International (Aug 20 2013),  and now I work as senior Architect, 
Full Stack Developer, Blockchain consultant, Machine Learning Engineer
